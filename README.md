# CARD-PAYMENT-SECURITY-USING-RSA
using rivest shamir adelman algorithm develop a card payment environment
RSA algorithm is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private. This project proposed an implementation of a complete and practical RSA encrypt/decrypt solution on CARD PAYMENT SECURITY, the study of RSA public key algorithm. In addition, the encrypt procedure and code implementation is provided in details.
